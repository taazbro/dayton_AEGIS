## 🎓 Demo Talking Points

### Opening (30 seconds)
> "Traditional cyber defense is reactive—by the time humans detect an attack,
> data is already gone. AEGIS changes that. It's an autonomous AI defense system
> that detects and neutralizes threats in under 5 seconds, with zero human intervention."

### During Attack Simulation (Phase 1)
> "Here you see an autonomous attacker simulating a SQL injection attack chain.
> Notice the multi-stage progression: scanning, injection, privilege escalation,
> data exfiltration. This mirrors real-world attack patterns."

### During Sentry Telemetry (Phase 2)
> "Sentry captures every event in real-time. You can see the severity levels,
> network connections, and attack progression. This is happening live, not mocked."

### During Detection (Phase 3)
> "AEGIS behavioral analyzer identified this as a SQL injection attack with
> 95.7% confidence. Response time: 4.7 seconds. Watch the automated actions:
> session termination, IP blocking, credential rotation, database isolation,
> container quarantine. All autonomous, all instant."

### During Claude Report (Phase 4)
> "Claude AI generates a complete forensic report. Notice the timeline analysis,
> threat categorization, and actionable recommendations. This is real Claude API
> running live, not simulated."

### During Slack Alert (Phase 5)
> "SOC team receives an immediate Slack notification with the full incident
> summary. By the time a human sees this alert, AEGIS has already neutralized
> the threat and isolated the damage."

### Closing (30 seconds)
> "That's AEGIS: autonomous detection, instant response, zero data loss.
> Traditional SOCs take minutes to hours. AEGIS takes 5 seconds.
> Questions?"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "./run_all.sh: Permission denied"
**Solution:**
```bash
chmod +x run_all.sh
./run_all.sh
```

### Issue: "SENTRY_DSN not set"
**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` file exists
2. Verify SENTRY_DSN is correct
3. Reload: `export $(cat .env | xargs)`

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError"
**Solution:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: "No incidents detected"
**Explanation:** Normal! Attack simulator runs periodically. Wait 10-30 seconds.

### Issue: Slack not sending
**Solution:**
1. Verify webhook URL is set
2. Test: `python3 src/integrations/slack_integration.py`
3. Check Slack app permissions
